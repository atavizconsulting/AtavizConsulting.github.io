									<p>Ataviz Consulting was brought in to optimize a mid-size Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatment provider's data pipeline and Power BI dashboard, with the goal of improving their data analysis and decision-making. Through the use of various tools and techniques, Ataviz Consulting was able to achieve significant improvements in file size and dashboard refresh loading times, resulting in fewer data crashes and more informed decision-making. This case study showcases the importance of data optimization in driving business success.</p>

									<h2>Goal:</h2>
									<p>Ataviz Consulting was hired by an Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) treatment provider to optimize their data pipeline and Power BI dashboard. The company was experiencing issues with slow connections, data crashes, and missing data, which was affecting their ability to analyze and make decisions based on their data. The goal of the project was to optimize the data pipeline, re-structure data relationships, remove unused calculated fields and measures, and optimize Power BI charts and dashboards to improve data analysis and decision-making.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<span class="image left"><img src="images/cs2-1.jpeg" alt="" /></span><h2>Tools:</h2>
									<p>Ataviz Consulting used a combination of tools and techniques to optimize their data pipeline and Power BI dashboard. They began by identifying holes and slow connections in the data pipeline, and then re-structured the data relationships between imported data from different sources to ensure consistency and accuracy. Ataviz Consulting also removed unused calculated fields and measures and analyzed and optimized Power BI charts and dashboards to ensure faster loading times and better data analysis. They also suggested a new and improved process for their data warehouse, which the company plans to implement in the future.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results:</h2>
									<p>Ataviz Consulting was able to complete the project within the allotted timeframe and budget. As a result of their work, they experienced a 22% decrease in overall file size and a 25% decrease in dashboard refresh loading times. These changes led to fewer data crashes and fewer instances of missing data from specific pipelines, allowing them to make more informed decisions based on their data. Additionally, the optimized Power BI dashboard allowed the company to quickly and easily create additional dashboards to support other departments within the company, further improving their ability to use data to drive their business.</p>

As a mid-size ABA treatment provider, we faced challenges with slow loading times and data crashes, hindering our decision-making. <br>Ataviz Consulting implemented various tools and techniques, achieving significant improvements in dashboard file size and loading times. Thanks to their efforts, we can now make data-driven decisions with ease, and our employees who use these dashboards on a daily basis now have optimized and streamlined versions to use.
