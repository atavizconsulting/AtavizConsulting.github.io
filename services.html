											<h3>Data Collection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Unsure about how to collect your data? Unsure about where your data is? Do you even have data?
										</p>
										<p>
											We can help with that! We can take the data you already have and collect and consolidate it. 
											We can use the systems you have in place to start collecting data about your business. 
											If you don't have the proper systems in place, we can work with you to determine a system 
											that fits your needs and begin the data collection and storage process.
										</p>
										<h3>Data Analytics</h3>
										<p></p>
										<p>
											Have your data, but aren't sure what it means or what to do with it?
										</p>
										<p>
											We can help with that too! We can take your data and analyze it in order to answer specific questions
											or to provide insights about what the data is saying. We can analyze your current and past data
											in order to find trends. We can provide reports, dashboards, and even presentations to break down
											the data analysis into easy-to-digest portions so you truly understand what your KPIs are telling you. 
											Make those important business decisions with the correct information, analysis, and understanding.
										</p>
										<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
										<p></p>
										<p>
											Want informative reports and dashboards to access and send out to your employees?
										</p>
										<p>
											Data visualization is the most misunderstood and underutilized part of data analytics. What if you could
											have a weekly report emailed to your team automatically that focuses on foot traffic and closing percentage?
											Then you could also have a monthly report automatically emailed to you that focuses on sold units and gross profit? 
											These aren't just possibilities, these are the steps businesses are taking every day to inform and improve
											those conversations with management about how to improve the bottom line.
										</p>
										<p>
											Additionally, what if you had an interactive dashboard you could look at where you can hover over portions of
											a chart for more information, or filter several charts with just one click? Now, all of that is both 
											affordable and within reach. And, you don't need to purchase any additional software! Data dashboards are the
											new way to visualize your KPIs while having the ability to highlight, filter, and deep dive into the data
											with just the click of a mouse.
										</p>
										<h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
										<p></p>
										<p>
											How do you use data analytics and KPIs to inform real business decisions?
										</p>
										<p>
											Leave the analytics, statistics and coding to us. This is where our founder's background in education really 
											gets to shine. We can present you with quick, easy to understand reports and presentations so that you can 
											focus on making the important business decisions... only this time more informed and more confident.
											Get to what really matters to you without all the fluff!
										</p>
										<h3>Forecasting</h3>
										<p></p>
										<p>
											What to expect next month? Next year?
										</p>
										<p>
											Data science combines the techniques of data analytics with statistics and programming in order to accurately
											forecast and predict future events based on past and current data. We have several forecasting methods at our
											disposal for a variety of use cases, including: 
											<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin:40px;">
												<li>basic straight-line method</li>
												<li>rolling averages</li>
												<li>linear regressions</li>
												<li>more complex regressions (polynomial, etc.)</li>
												<li>exponential smoothing (time series analysis)</li>
											</ul>
