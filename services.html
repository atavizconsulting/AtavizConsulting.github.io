							<h1 class="major">Services Offered</h1>
							<p>
								We tailor our services to exactly what you need. Maybe you need one specific service, or maybe you need a little bit of everything.
								No project is too big or too small for us to handle. We will work within your budget to accomplish your goals and answer your business questions.
							</p>
							<h2>Services</h2>
							<p></p>
							<h3>Data Collection and ETL</h3>
							<p>
								<i>What data do you have access to? Where is it located? Where can you store it?</i><br />
								We can find affordable (or even free) ways to collect and store your data securely for you.
								We can transform your data into usable data for further analysis and visualization.
								Aren't sure if you even have data? We can find data that you may not even know you've been collecting,
								or we can begin your data collection for you via your current systems, observations, experiments, or surveys.
							</p>
							<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
							<p>
								<i>What is your data trying to tell you? What insights can you gain from analying your data?</i><br />
								We can take your data and analyze it in order to answer specific questions or to provide insights about what the data is saying. 
								We can analyze your current and past data in order to find trends. We can provide reports, dashboards, and even presentations 
								to break down the data analysis into easy-to-digest portions so you truly understand what your KPIs are telling you. 
								Make those important business decisions with the correct information, analysis, and understanding.
							</p>
							<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
							<p>
								<i>What visualizations would help you and your employees make better business decisions?</i><br />
								What if you could have a weekly report emailed to your team automatically that focuses on foot traffic and closing percentage? 
								Or a monthly report automatically emailed to you that focuses on sold units and gross profit? 
								Additionally, what if you had an interactive dashboard you could look at where you can hover over portions of a chart for more information, 
								or filter several charts with just one click?<br />
								These aren't just possibilities, these are the steps businesses are taking every day to inform conversations with management about how to improve the bottom line.
								And, you don't need to purchase any additional software! Data dashboards are the new way to visualize your KPIs while having the ability to 
								highlight, filter, and deep dive into the data with just the click of a mouse.
							</p>
							<h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
							<p>
								<i>How can you use data analytics and your KPIs to inform business decisions?</i><br />
								Leave the analytics, statistics and coding to us. This is where our founder's background in education really gets to shine. 
								We can present you with quick, easy to understand reports and presentations so that you can focus on making the important business decisions... 
								only this time more informed and more confident. Get to what really matters to you without all the fluff!
							</p>
							<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
							<p>
								<i>Could you use a machine learning model to predict which customers will default on a loan?</i><br />
								Does Chat GPT interest you? You too can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to be two steps ahead in your business.
								We will take your data and train a computer model to learn from it in order to make future predictions about your customer base.
							</p>
							<h3>Forecasting</h3>
							<p>
								<i>What should you expect in sales next month? How much inventory should you order this spring?</i><br />
								Data science combines the techniques of data analytics with statistics and programming in order to accurately forecast and predict future events based on past and current data. 
								We have several forecasting methods at our disposal for a variety of use cases, including using linear methods, exponential smoothing, and seasonal adjustments.
