									<p>Basement Brewed Fantasy Football is an online platform that offers valuable resources and tools to help fantasy football players win their leagues. To provide a more interactive and user-friendly experience for their customers, Ataviz Consulting was hired to create several interactive dashboards using Tableau, a powerful data visualization software. The dashboards enable users to easily access and analyze critical data points related to player rankings, team rankings, team spreads, touchdown regression candidates, and much more, resulting in increased customer engagement and revenue. Ataviz Consulting was also asked to automate data collection for their weekly analysis. The web scraping and automation saves Basement Brewed Fantasy Football a minimum of 20 hours per week in data collection and organization.</p>

									<h2>Goal:</h2>
									<p><b>Interactive Dashboards: </b>Basement Brewed Fantasy Football wanted to create a more interactive and user-friendly experience for their customers. They wanted to provide valuable insights and tools that would help fantasy football players make more informed decisions during the season. Ataviz Consulting's goal was to create a set of dashboards that would enable users to easily access and analyze critical data points.</p>
									<p><b>Web Scraping and Automation: </b>Basement Brewed Fantasy Football needed a way to automate their data collection and organization process for analyzing the myriad of fantasy football data each week during the season. Ataviz Consulting's goal was to automate this process, freeing up a minimum of 20 hours each week during the season, when they are at their busiest.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Tools:</h2>
									<p><b>Interactive Dashboards: </b>Ataviz Consulting created several interactive dashboards for Basement Brewed Fantasy Football using Tableau, a powerful data visualization software. One dashboard was the main Heat Map, which consisted of weekly player rankings, team rankings, team spreads, team over/unders, touchdown regression candidates, and weekly streamer candidates. Another dashboard was the Live Draft Rankings dashboard, which was designed to provide users with a live resource that updates itself during the customer's fantasy football draft. This resource provides valuable information about player rankings, player analysis, dynamic average draft position (ADP), a historical time series look at the ADP value over time, and other key metrics related to the draft process. All dashboards were designed to be interactive, engaging, and filterable, making it easy for users to find the information they need quickly.</p>
									<p><b>Web Scraping and Automation: </b>Ataviz Consulting created a web scraping and automation script that Basement Brewed Fantasy Football can run that will generate all of the data sets needed to perform their weekly analysis. These data sets then get copied into a spreadsheet, which automates the organization process of the data and lays out the data in a visually appealing format, ready for analysis.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results:</h2>
									<p><b>Interactive Dashboards: </b>The interactive dashboards created by Ataviz Consulting had a significant impact on Basement Brewed Fantasy Football's revenue. The dashboards helped to increase customer engagement and retention by providing users with valuable insights and tools that they could use to make more informed decisions both during the season and during the offseason. By driving more customers to the platform, the dashboards helped to increase revenue for Basement Brewed Fantasy Football, establishing the platform as a leading resource for fantasy football players.</p>
									<p><b>Web Scraping and Automation: </b>The web scraping and automation process takes under 2 minutes to run, saving the Basement Brewed Fantasy Football a minimum of 20 hours each week having to complete this process manually. This process saves time and money, allowing the client to spend more time each week interacting with their clients and marketing their product as opposed to collecting and organizing data.</p>
